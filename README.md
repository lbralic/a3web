# Web Design and Programming Assignment 3: Group 7

### To break up the work evenly we have split the template page into several sections 

Individuals will work together on some parts of the template where other sections will primarily be covered individually. Throughout the process we will keep an open line of communication and if any section ends up taking longer than anticipated, individual template assignments will be edited to make sure the work is even. Additionally, new sections may be added while starting the template that may result in the following assignments being edited. 

Navigation Bar - Jessica 

HTML for paragraphs – Meghan  

CSS – template and modifications - Esther 

Java script – interactivity (jQuery?) - Kevin

External links - Lucija 

Finding Opensource Images - Lucija 

Website content – write content for paragraphs, headers etc. - All

Footer – Meghan  

Contact form - Kevin 

Fake logo - Jessica 

# Pages of webpage 

### Once a template page has been created we will be splitting up the remaining pages evenly to spread out the workload.
