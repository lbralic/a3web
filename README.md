## Plan for Template Creation 

### Workload Breakdown

Individuals will work together on some parts of the template where other sections will primarily be covered individually. Throughout the process we will keep an open line of communication and if any section ends up taking longer than anticipated, individual template assignments will be edited to make sure the work is even. Additionally, new sections may be added while starting the template that may result in the edits to the following assignments.  

HTML and CSS for Navigation Bar - Jessica

## Website Sections

We have a group of 5, as such we will have a total of 10 pages. The theme of the website is a Environmental GIS Consulting Agency and we will be using a combination of true and made up content on the website. We have opted to build our own CSS and HTML templates based on elements we have learned in class and elements we like from various other websites.
