  <p> Meghan Noonan is a Perth based GIS consultant specializing in spatial analysis and programming. 
    Prior to starting at GeomSolutions Meghan completed her MSc at the Memorial University where her research focused on 
    modelling forest restoration scenarios after moose overbrowsing. Much of her research utilized aerial imagery analysis 
    and model building which led her to develop a passion for GIS. She has now been working with GeomSolutions for five years
    where she has worked on a variety of projects including capturing drone imagery of conservation land, building spatial models

  <p> Jessica Murdoch has been a GIS Analyst with GeomSolutions for just over a year now, where she has been able to use her previous experience to 
    provide outstanding service to our customers. Before becoming a member of the team last year, she completed a MSc at York University where her research was 
    focused on exploring associations between cyanobacteria blooms and the related environmental factors that are causing mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes in Ontario
     to be experiencing an increase in blooms. This research utilized different spatial analysis techniques, database creation and management and programming to customize geographical information.
     Jessica has quickly become a valuable member of the team with a multi-disciplinary background and her passion for environmental monitoring. See Jessica's <a class="teamlinks" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-murdoch"> linkedin</a>
