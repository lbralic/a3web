# Web Design and Programming Assignment 3: Group 7

### Workload Breakdown

Individuals will work together on some parts of the template where other sections will primarily be covered individually. Throughout the process we will keep an open line of communication and if any section ends up taking longer than anticipated, individual template assignments will be edited to make sure the work is even. Additionally, new sections may be added while starting the template that may result in the edits to the following assignments.
