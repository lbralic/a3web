<!-- Content Written By Meghan -->	
<p> I am a Perth based GIS consultant specializing in spatial analysis and programming. 
	Prior to starting at GeomSolutions I completed my MSc at the Memorial University where my research focused on 
	modelling forest restoration scenarios after moose overbrowsing. Much of my research utilized aerial imagery analysis 
	and model building which led me to develop a passion for GIS. I have now been working with GeomSolutions for five years
	where I have worked on a variety of projects including capturing drone imagery of conservation land, building spatial models
	to analyze deforestation trends, and using LANDSAT imagery to classify land use. GeomSolutions has a fantastic team, and we look
	forward to working with you on your next project!</p>
